## App Accelerator Workshop
This repo is step by step guide on how to learn various aspects of application accelerator i.e. UI, engine, and transformations. Each step is broken up in modular section and added as a separate branch. You can follow individual branch or skip and try out the last `complete-lab` branch.

### UI Options
* Check out `ui-options` branch
* Register the accelerator to TAP or Azure Spring Apps Instance. (If sharing same instance, change the accelerator & display name to avoid someone overriding it)
* If this accelerator is already registered, ensure you change the branch to `ui-options`
* This lab shows you all the possible input options. 
* [View difference from registration branch](https://github.com/dipalpat/app-accelerator-workshop/compare/registration...ui-options)
  
Proceed to the next lab and checkout `transforms-1` branch.
